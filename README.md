### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alejandro PatiÃ±o, Electronic engineer with experience in
development of software. I'm a self-taugh person who likes to
learn new things every day especially things related to tech. 
I also like challenges because I can learn from them and they
make me give my best. 

In my free times, I'm learning web development in order to create my own apps and maybe to start my own business in the future.
